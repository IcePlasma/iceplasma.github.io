        <td><b>Maze Generator/solver</b></td>
      </tr>
    <tr>Implemented a disjoint set algorithm for generating a maze. Algorithm’s worst case was nearly linear. After the maze was generated, treasures were added in random locations. The maze was then explored with a recursive depth first traversal that found the path from start to finish that would find all of the treasures.</tr>

        <td>2-D platformer made in Unity Game Engine</td>
      </tr>
        <tr>I have been making a 2-D platform game in Unity on and off since the summer of 2015. This project is still unfinished, but I’ve learned a lot doing it. It’s the only project I’ve done in C#, and I was new to the language when I started the project.</tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Dungeons and Dragons Combat Simulator</td>
      </tr>
        <tr>This was a program to simulate combat between two characters in dungeons and dragons and collect statistical data on which character would win fights the most often. The original purpose of this software was to prove that using two weapons is not a viable strategy compared with using a single weapon with both hands. I eventually added the ability to fight a slime creature that would split into 2 slimes with half as much health whenever it was hit with a weapon.</tr>

        <td>Grading Software</td>
      </tr>
        <tr>This was a program to compile all of the assignments in a folder that followed a specific naming convention. It would then run all of  the executables and save their output to a text file. It was only compatible with Windows. I made this as a favor for for the professor that I helped with grading.</tr>
