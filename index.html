          Hello World! My name is Samuel Meyerding, and I would like to say welcome to my webpage. 
          I am now going to talk about some of my more favorite computer science projects I've worked 
          on in my life.

          Implemented a disjoint set algorithm for generating a maze. Algorithm’s 
          worst case was nearly linear. After the maze was generated, treasures were 
          added in random locations. The maze was then explored with a recursive depth 
          first traversal that found the path from start to finish that would find all
          of the treasures. Below is a screenshot of this programs output.

            I have been making a 2-D platform game in Unity on and off since the summer 
            of 2015. This project is still unfinished, but I’ve learned a lot doing it. 
            It’s the only project I’ve done in C#, and I was new to the language when 
            I started the project.

            This was a program to simulate combat between two characters 
            in dungeons and dragons and collect statistical data on which character 
            would win fights the most often. The original purpose of this software 
            was to prove that using two weapons is not a viable strategy compared 
            with using a single weapon with both hands. I eventually added the ability 
            to fight a slime creature that would split into 2 slimes with half as much 
            health whenever it was hit with a weapon.

            This was a program to compile all of the assignments in a folder 
            that followed a specific naming convention. It would then run all of  
            the executables and save their output to a text file. It was only compatible 
            with Windows. I made this as a favor for for the professor that I helped 
            with grading.
