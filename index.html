          My name is Samuel Meyerding, and I would like to say welcome to my webpage. 
          I decided to go for a simple look that's easy on the eyes in order to
          save time and because I quite like the look.
          I am now going to talk about some of my more favorite computer science projects I've worked 
          on in my life.

          Implemented a disjoint set algorithm for generating a maze. Algorithm’s 
          worst case was nearly linear. After the maze was generated, treasures were 
          added in random locations. The maze was then explored with a recursive depth 
          first traversal that found the path from start to finish that would find all
          of the treasures. Below is a screenshot of this program's output. Here's a link
          to a github page with a linux version of the code

            I have been making a 2-D platform game in Unity on and off since the summer 
            of 2015. This project is still unfinished, but I’ve learned a lot doing it. 
            It’s the only project I’ve done in C#, and I was new to the language when 
            I started the project. Below is some test footage for this game. Also,
            my brother made the sprite for the on screen character.

            This was a collaborative project where I worked with Tiana Greisel. We 
            implemented an inventory tracker for a movie store that read customers, 
            moveis, and transactions from text files and stored all of that information 
            in data structures. The customers were stored in a hash table, the transactions
            were stored in a linked list that was part of each customer, and the moveis
            were stored in a binary tree.

        <tr>
          <td>
            This was a program to simulate combat between two characters 
            in dungeons and dragons and collect statistical data on which character 
            would win fights the most often. The original purpose of this software 
            was to prove that using two weapons is not a viable strategy compared 
            with using a single weapon with both hands. I eventually added the ability 
            to fight a slime creature that would split into 2 slimes with half as much 
            health whenever it was hit with a weapon.

          <td>
            This was a program to compile all of the assignments in a folder 
            that followed a specific naming convention. It would then run all of  
            the executables and save their output to a text file. It was only compatible 
            with Windows. I made this as a favor for for the professor that I helped 
            with grading.
