          My name is Samuel Meyerding, and I would like to say welcome to my webpage. 
          I decided to go for a simple look that's easy on the eyes in order to
          save time and because I quite like the look. I'm a computer scientist
          with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering
          from the University of Washington Bothell.
          Below is a list of some of my more favorite computer science projects I've worked 
          on in my life.

          I was the developer lead for Ghostlight Manor until April 2019. Ghostlight Manor is 
	  a 2-d game made in Unity using C#. While I was the developer lead, I added 
	  AI opponents, split screen multiplayer over a network, a new UI navigation system for 
	  controllers, various redesigns of UI for different parts of the game, and a new 
	  tutorial for multiplayer. All of these changes have been pushed to the Steam build of 
	  the game.

          I had an idea for a fairly simple sudoku solver in 2020. It is a brute force solver that
	  stores the values that are currently being used by each row, column, and square
	  so that it can determine which values can be inserted into each row, column, and 
	  square more quickly.

          I worked on Corrupted for a year starting during June 2017. It is a 2-d Unity game that is 
	  a mash up between a match 3 game and a spin on Breakout. When I first started 
	  working on Corrupted, it was a very buggy mess of a game. The first build of the
	  game I played was called SomehwatWorkingCorrupted. It had optimization issues, crashes,
	  features that didn't work, and multiple game breaking bugs. It is currently a working
	  demo.

          I worked on a 2-d tower defence game in 2018 with a custom Javascript game engine for a class
	  called 2-d Game Engine Development. There were two other people working on this project, and
	  we made the game in three weeks. The game was about defending a piece of toast in the middle 
	  of the map from ants. The game works best in Firefox.

          Implemented a disjoint set algorithm for generating a maze in 2015. Algorithm’s 
          worst case was nearly linear. After the maze was generated, treasures were 
          added in random locations. The maze was then explored with a recursive depth 
          first traversal that found the path from start to finish that would find all
          of the treasures. Below is a screenshot of this program's output. Here's a link

            moveis, and transactions from text files and stored all of that information 
            in data structures. The customers were stored in a hash table, the transactions
            were stored in a linked list that was part of each customer, and the moveis
            were stored in a binary tree.

            in dungeons and dragons and collect statistical data on which character 
            would win fights the most often. The original purpose of this software 
            was to prove that using two weapons is not a viable strategy compared 
            with using a single weapon with both hands. I eventually added the ability 
            to fight a slime creature that would split into 2 slimes with half as much 
            health whenever it was hit with a weapon.

			The biggest hurdle with this was figuring out the nonstandard bit
			lengths for each of these attributes and their ids. Each of these
			attributes has a nine bit id followed by a value that can be 8, 9, 11, 13,
			21, 25, or 32 bits in length depending on the attribute.

			This is the problem of placing eight queens on a chess board without any of them being
			able to take eachother. I had the idea of storing the positions of the queens as a 64
			bit value with an adjacency matrix that is also stored as a 64 bit value. For each possible
			queen position, it generates an adjacency matrix with all of the positions a queen in that
			position could move into. When a queen is inserted into a position, the resulting adjacency
			matrix is found with a bitwise or between the current state of the board and the adjacency matrix for
			a queen in that position.

			in one tab rather than an individual tab for each card.
